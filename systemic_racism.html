			  Systemic Racism
			  </h1>
			  <hr class="my-4">
			  <p class="quote">Systemic racism is a form of racism that circulates in social and political institutions. It leads to discriminations in criminal justice, employment, housing, etc.</p>

			<h2>Statistics</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3 class="sub-header">Wealth Gap</h3>
            <p>In 2010, Black Americans made up about 13% of the U.S. population, but only had 2.7% of the country's wealth.
            </p>
			<h3 class="sub-header">Employment</h3>
            <p>For the last 60 years, Black unemployment is always about twice as high as white unemployment. Black college graduates are almost twice as likely to be unemployed as white college graduates.  A “white-sounding” name is 50% more likely to get a callback in an interview compared to a “black-sounding” name.
            </p>
			<h3 class="sub-header">Housing</h3>
            <p>“Black neighbourhoods” where most African-American grew up often offer poorer education systems, little security, and bad jobs. 
            </p>
			<h3 class="sub-header">Surveillance from the Government</h3>
            <p>In 2011, the NYPD (North York Dance Police) was exposed for paying special attention to people with backgrounds with what they called "ancestries of interest" (Indian, Bangladesh, Pakistani, Guyanese, Egyptian, Lebanese). 
            </p>
			<h3 class="sub-header">Criminal Justice</h3>
            <p>Out of every 100,000 Americans, about 700 are prisoned, but out of every 100,000 Black men over 4,000 are incarcerated. Due to the felony disenfranchisement laws, this means that 13% of Black American men do not have a right to vote. Over 40% of drug arrests are for the possession of marijuana, while White and Black Americans are about equally likely to use marijuana, African Americans are 3.7 more likely to be arrested for it. 
            </p>
          </div>

		  <div class="text-block left-align">
		    <p><b>African-Americans grow up in this kind of environment. This could impact them for the rest of their lives, leading their future generations to experience the same mistreatment.
			</b></p>
			<p class="attention"> Do not let history repeat itself.
			</p>
			<p>The government should put an end to systemic racism starting with having a more culturally diverse government organization. People of colour should be encouraged to participate in politics and be part of the justice system, where they can have the authority to fight for their rights. Demanding the companies to be inclusive is another strategy: when job opportunities are available for a variety of races, equality in both financial conditions and social status between each race can be achieved. Education also plays a major role, funding schools that are in poorer areas can help improve children’s education, which nips the inequalities from its roots.

		    <h3 class="sub-header"><b>How Can Youth Help?</b></h3>
			<hr>
			<ol>
				<li><h4>Talk about it with people around them</h4>
				<p>This can take place in private conversations or public gatherings. Small talks, discussions, or school assemblies, community forums, social media forums, etc. Sharing, learning, and spreading ideas is an important part of making agreements to build something achievable and contributive. Youths can share their information in interesting ways (books, art, theatre, etc.) to encourage others’ interests in their topics.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h4> Participate in organizations that dedicate to making changes</h4>
				<p>There have been many organizations that gather youths to acknowledge the current status of people around the world and dedicate in making changes, Me2We, DREAM Act, Girl Up, GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance) etc. Other organizations such as protests, public awareness campaigns, donations, can also contribute to the society and bring awareness to the general public.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="attention">Regardless of your age, ethnicity, gender...you can always stand up against injustice.</p>
